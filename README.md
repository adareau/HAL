## Some useful commands

```

**Add folder to python path (conda)**

$> conda develop /path/to/folder
```

## PyQtGraph

We use the PyQtGraph package for image and data display (mostly because it is faster than matplotlib). Useful links :

* [official website](http://www.pyqtgraph.org/)
* [documentation](https://pyqtgraph.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)

To see examples (useful to start programming):

```bash
$> python -m pyqtgraph.examples
```
